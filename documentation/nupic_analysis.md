# Nupic

It's an opensource implementation of Numenta's HTM theory. It has all the good stuff in there!

Pros:

* Implmentations of all the important pieces, Math, Algorithms, Dataflow-Network (aka Engine)

Cons:

* Sort of dated c++ code
* There might be a lot of code that's not needed anymore, like SVM?
* Still uses old python 2.7
* A lot of "meat" is implemented in python



## Math

### Matrix classes



## Engine

There must be a better way to create a network of operators. I don't think reinventing the wheel is necessary.

## Algorithms

This is the real stuff!

### Spatial Pooling

### TM
